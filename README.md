# Gate_Level_Trojans
This is a project for my hardware security class that takes in a gate level design for a circuit and then adds the defined trojan to the design

Lectures Helpful for this project from EECS 690 Introduction to Hardware Security:
• Lecture 9 Hardware Description Language (HDL)
• Lecture 7/8 maybe for reference but not relied on
• Lecture 6 for sure
